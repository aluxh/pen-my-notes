# Ideas for making money with Machine Learning, Data Science and AI

These are ideas and inspiration taken from people sharing online, articles read and etc.

## Start-up

- Focus on vertical and niche solutions. And, make sure you perform well in that "category".
- Create Dataset that you could find, build API and sell access to them.
- Leverage on your domain knowledge, build data products for them.

Some of my favourite companies are: [Narrative Science](https://narrativescience.com/), [MonkeyLearn](https://monkeylearn.com/).

Some problems I'm interested in:

- Helping small businesses (really small ones) to survive
  - Digitalize
  - Build Awareness & Outreach
  - How to better spend their funds (since earning them is so difficult)
  - How to improve their productivity
- Poverty
- Natural Language Processing-related

**Note to self:** Think of a problem, consider the problems in Consumer or Enterprise Market.

## Freelance/Contract Work

Building personal brand is important for freelancing. To demonstrate your abilities, as well as knowledge.

- Writing a technical blog (turning into a book - self-publishing)
  - Recurring revenue (passive income - write once, sell many times)

## Build Sub-Projects

- Projects that help you earn money, as well as becoming a blog for writing
  - Automated trading bot for trading
  - Building analytics tools for Wordpress/WooCommerce.
  - Building recommender system tool for Wordpress/WooCommerce.
  - Building machine translation tool for Wordpress.

## Compete in Competitions
