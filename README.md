# Pen my notes

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/aluxh/pen-my-notes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/aluxh/pen-my-notes)

This is my repo for storing notes about my learnings, and my personal cheatsheets of things I do, and learn. And, at the same time, I'm also taking this opportunity to learn CI with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/). 

Currently, the notes are very messy, because I've created them very quickly, without thinking too much about how do structure them, so if you are reading this, please pardon me.

I'm going to take some time to re-organize my notes (I hope soon).
